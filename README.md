# ECG Heartbeat Classification
The electrocardiogram (ECG) can be used to consistently monitor the cardiovascular system's functioning. Recently, there has been a lot of focus on correct heartbeat classification. While there are numerous similarities between different ECG situations, most research have focused on categorizing a set of conditions using a dataset labeled for that job rather than learning and applying transferable information across tasks. In this repository, a technique for heartbeat classification based on deep convolutional neural networks has been proposed that can reliably diagnose five distinct arrhythmias in compliance with the AAMI EC57 standard.
